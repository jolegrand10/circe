# CIRCE

An example of how to benefit from a continuous integration workflow hosted at GitHub to control the evolutions of a simple Python project.

This project is "non-packaged", i.e. not intended to be built and distributed as a package. Goals are to
- organize code in files
- run tests
- use linters and formatters
- manage dependencies

# 1st step
- Create project repo @ Git Hub
- Clone it to dev workstation and sync from there or use codespace@github
- Collect an initial   [.gitignore file @ GitHub](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore)
- Create folders for sources (src), tests (tests) and scripts (scripts)
